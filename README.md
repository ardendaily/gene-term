#gene-term

ascii-aesthetics-cum-genetic-sequencing, in python

-----------

this is a totally weird project i threw together in a several-hour 
sprint. the program tries to ascend the value of rows of letters with 
basic genetic algorithms. it succeeds, depending on your definition of success. 

### want to try it out?

`git clone https://github.com/ardendaily/gene-term.git`

`cd gene-term`

`python gene-term.py`

razzle dazzle!
